# Nmap Network and Vulnerability Scanning

## Project Description
The project aimed to use Nmap for network scanning and security auditing. Through hands-on exploration, the project utilized essential skills in network scanning, including host discovery, port scanning, service enumeration, operating system detection, and vulnerability detection.

### Tools Used

- **Nmap** for network and vulnerability scanning
- **Bash** shell for executing command-line commands.

### Skills Learned

- Port scanning and host discovery
- Service and OS enumeration for detailed network insights
- Vulnerability detection to identify potential security risks
- Customized scans and output management for efficient reporting
  
### Project Certificate Of Completion

Running a scan with options where:
- targets ports 22-80
- on target: scanme.nmap.org
- enables OS and version detection, script scanning and traceroute
- sets scan to -T3 for time of scan
- outputs the scan to a file: output.txt
